I am still on that one-hour break routine because of my neck injury, so I will see you in a bit.&nbsp; I\u2019m back, and I just removed my mini sweet potato recipe from the oven and when it cools I will photograph it for this update.&nbsp; I enjoyed the squash recipe for dinner as I prepared it yesterday and placed it in the refrigerator over night and baked it for 30 minutes.&nbsp; Yum!&nbsp; It is a good thing that the most enjoyable task for me is being in the kitchen cooking and because I didn\u2019t have a photo-didn\u2019t have digital at the time-and I had to eat, I made two mini recipes.&nbsp; I will be doubling the recipes for Thanksgiving. Hopefully, you will be able to try 1 or 2 of them.&nbsp; If not file them away for next year or use them for your vegetable dish during the year or at least in the winter.&nbsp; Remember that healthy hint \u201cEat in season\u201d and sweet potatoes and butternut squash are root vegetables and keep in a cool environment for a very long period. In earlier times vegetables for kept in a cold cellar or pickled and would sustain people through the cold winter.&nbsp; It sure makes sense to me and as always \u201cMother Nature knows best.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-top: 4px;\">Well, I am not going to waste any more time chatting and get right to sharing my recipes and from all the feed back I received when I introduced them I can guarantee that you guest will enjoy them.&nbsp; Oh, I just received a call from my daughter asking me a question pertaining to the easy and never fail piecrust recipe that I shared some time ago.&nbsp; She asked if she could make it today and refrigerate it overnight-of course, but let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes before you attempt to roll it and for you who are piecrust making challenged you can omit the roiling step and just pat it in your pie plate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-top: 4px;\">In a measuring cup, stir together oil and milk.&nbsp; In a medium bowl stir together flour, salt and sugar if using.&nbsp; Add canola oil mixture and stir with fork until blended.
